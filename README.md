# Stellar
Blockchain application built on the Stellar network

Problem:
Researchers require lots of data:
- which must be acquired (where to get the data from), filtered (ensure the data is relevant), tagged (extract the useful data from it), validated (real data, fill in missing information, remove biases)

Idea:
> Main : Provide an interface for users to input data
> Secondary : Provide an interface for researchers to buy the data

Audience:
> Sports science researchers testing various mesocycles and exercises

Use of Stellar:
> Utilise Stellar Network to...

Research:
???

Feedback:
- Data must be anonymized - i.e uk gov data
- Time for adoption will be too long - (and too convoluted? why not bank transfer - regulatory constraints)
+ Possible - market surveys done randomly - connect to patient better
+ CONTRACT HIGHLY RELEVANT
+ Anonymization easy
+ No consent problems
- Data duplication
- Regulated data?
- Marketing
+ Lots of potentialy uses i.e diabetes matching
+ Scalable - company size / infreq, high volume transactions

Goals:
> Minimal clicks mobile UI for consumers
> Privacy info
> Web ui for researches
> Generalised smart contract
